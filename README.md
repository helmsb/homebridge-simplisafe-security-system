# homebridge-simplisafe-security-system

This project is a [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) pluging that allows you to control your SimpliSafe alarm system with the iOS 10 Home app as well as through Siri. This project uses the [SimpliSafe SS3 node.js wrapper](https://github.com/chowielin/simplisafe-ss3-nodejs). To use this, you must have a working Homebridge server running in your network.

## Notes

- The "night" toggle in the iOS 10 Home App UI sets the alarm state to "home" in SimpliSafe. This is due to SimpliSafe not having a dedicated "night" mode.
- Usage of this plugin requires the extra \$10/month online monitoring plan, since that enables the required API endpoints to control the alarm remotely.
